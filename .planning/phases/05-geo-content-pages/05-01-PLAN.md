<objective>
Create the /near-grand-canyon/ page with AI-extractable passage structure targeting Grand Canyon proximity queries. First, extend Layout.astro to accept optional OpenGraph props so all pages (including this one and future /directions/) get page-specific OG tags.

Purpose: Capture "Indian restaurant near Grand Canyon" queries in AI engines and Google by providing answer-first content with per-city distance facts as standalone extractable paragraphs.

Output: Live /near-grand-canyon/ page with answer-first H1, 7 city distance facts, dish recommendations, cross-links, and page-specific OG/meta tags.

  <name>Task 1: Extend Layout.astro with optional OpenGraph props</name>
  <files>src/layouts/Layout.astro</files>
  <action>
Add three optional props to Layout.astro's frontmatter destructuring: `ogTitle`, `ogDescription`, `ogUrl`.

In the frontmatter, extend the props destructuring:
```
const {
  title = 'Spice Grill & Bar | Best Indian & Punjabi Food in Ash Fork, AZ (Route 66)',
  description = '...',
  ogTitle,
  ogDescription,
  ogUrl,
} = Astro.props;
```

Update the three hardcoded OG meta tags in `<head>` to use the new props with fallback to current static values:
- `og:url` → `content={ogUrl ?? 'https://spicegrillbar66.com'}`
- `og:title` → `content={ogTitle ?? 'Spice Grill & Bar | Authentic Punjabi Cuisine on Route 66'}`
- `og:description` → `content={ogDescription ?? 'Best Indian food in Ash Fork, AZ. Biker-friendly stop on Route 66 near the Grand Canyon. Try our famous butter chicken and garlic naan.'}`

Also update the Twitter meta tags similarly:
- `twitter:url` → `content={ogUrl ?? 'https://spicegrillbar66.com'}`
- `twitter:title` → `content={ogTitle ?? 'Spice Grill & Bar | Authentic Punjabi Cuisine on Route 66'}`
- `twitter:description` → `content={ogDescription ?? 'Best Indian food in Ash Fork, AZ. Perfect pit stop for Grand Canyon travelers.'}`

Do NOT change the existing `title`, `description`, or any other props. Do NOT modify the Props interface if one exists — Astro infers types from destructuring. Do NOT change `og:image`, `og:site_name`, `og:locale`, or `twitter:card`. Existing pages that pass no OG props will continue to get the current static values.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — build must succeed. Inspect `dist/index.html` and `dist/faq/index.html` to confirm OG tags still contain the original static values (regression check).</verify>
  <done>Layout.astro accepts optional ogTitle, ogDescription, ogUrl props. Pages not passing these props still render with the original hardcoded OG values.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create /near-grand-canyon/ page with AEO passage structure</name>
  <files>src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro` following the faq.astro page shell pattern. The page structure:

**Layout props:**
- `title`: "Indian Restaurant Near Grand Canyon | About 78 Miles — Spice Grill & Bar"
- `description`: "Spice Grill & Bar in Ash Fork, AZ is about 78 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim — roughly 1 hour 20 minutes via I-40 Exit 146. Authentic Punjabi food on Route 66."
- `ogTitle`: "Indian Restaurant Near Grand Canyon — Spice Grill & Bar"
- `ogDescription`: "About 78 miles from Grand Canyon South Rim. Authentic Punjabi cuisine at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, AZ."
- `ogUrl`: "https://spicegrillbar66.com/near-grand-canyon/"

**Page structure (inside `<main class="pt-32 pb-24 px-6 bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-black min-h-screen">` > `<div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">`)**:

1. **Answer-first H1** — Bold, large (text-4xl md:text-5xl font-serif font-bold). Text: "Spice Grill & Bar —" with the distance part in a `<span class="text-brand-orange">` e.g. "About 78 Miles from Grand Canyon South Rim". Text-left (not centered). Use class `mb-6 text-zinc-900 dark:text-white`.

2. **Lead paragraph** — text-lg, text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300, mb-12, leading-relaxed. A 2-3 sentence self-contained answer: Spice Grill & Bar is in Ash Fork, AZ, about 78 miles south of the Grand Canyon South Rim — roughly 1 hour 20 minutes via AZ-64 South and I-40 Exit 146. It's the closest Indian restaurant to the Grand Canyon on the I-40 corridor. A brief Route 66 mention is OK but don't make it the theme.

3. **Per-city distance section** — `<section>` with `<h2>` "Distance from Nearby Cities" (styled like faq.astro h3: text-xl font-serif font-semibold + dark/light colors + mb-8).

   Each city fact as a **standalone `<p>` element** (NOT list items). Use class `text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed mb-4`. Third person voice. Format: "Spice Grill & Bar is {distance} from {City} — about {drive time} {direction} on I-40. Take Exit 146 in Ash Fork."

   7 cities in order (nearest first): Williams (18 mi / 18 min), Seligman (25 mi / 24 min), Flagstaff (51 mi / 46 min), Grand Canyon South Rim (78 mi / 1 hr 20 min), Kingman (97 mi / 1.5 hr), Phoenix (144 mi / 2 hr 41 min), Las Vegas (200 mi / 3 hr), Los Angeles (414 mi / 6 hr).

   NOTE: That's 8 entries (7 cities + Grand Canyon). Grand Canyon gets special treatment since it's the page topic. For Grand Canyon include the route detail "via AZ-64 South and I-40". For Phoenix note "via I-17 North and I-40 West".

   Wrap each city `<p>` in a card-like container if desired (like faq.astro's bg-white dark:bg-zinc-900/50 p-8 rounded-2xl border) for visual consistency — Claude's discretion but keep it clean and text-focused.

4. **Dish recommendations section** — `<section>` with `<h2>` "What to Order on Your Road Trip" (same h2 styling). Feature the top 5 popular items from menu.json:
   - Fish Pakora ($10.99) — marinated fish in chickpea batter
   - Butter Chicken ($15.99) — rich butter-cream tomato sauce with chicken thighs
   - Shahi Paneer ($15.99) — cottage cheese in buttery cream sauce
   - Chicken Biryani ($17.99) — basmati rice with chicken and spices
   - Garlic Naan ($3.99) — fresh naan with butter and garlic

   Use "We recommend..." voice for this section per CONTEXT.md. Each dish: bold name, price, one-liner. Can use a simple grid or stacked list. Keep it compact.

5. **Hours + contact info block** — Small section below dishes. Include hours (Mon closed, Tue-Thu 8AM-9PM, Fri-Sun 8AM-10PM), phone ((928) 277-1292 with `tel:+19282771292` link), address (33 Lewis Ave, Ash Fork, AZ 86320). Use `<address>` element. Brief — 5-6 lines. This supports "is it open now" queries for AEO.

6. **Cross-links section** — Two prominent links (styled as buttons or cards):
   - "Get Directions from Your City" → `/directions/` (trailing slash)
   - "View Full Menu" → `/` (homepage, trailing slash)
   Use keyword-containing anchor text. Style with brand-orange accents. Include `font-semibold` for weight.

**Styling guidelines:**
- Match homepage visual style: use dark:bg-zinc-900/50 card backgrounds, brand-orange accents, glassmorphism borders where appropriate
- No images — text-only page for fast LCP
- Mobile-first: stack everything, generous padding
- Use Tailwind responsive classes (md: prefix for desktop enhancements)
- All internal links must have trailing slashes

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Do NOT use `<li>` for city distance facts — each must be `<p>`
- Do NOT add any images above the fold
- Do NOT use `client:load` on anything
- Do NOT import GoogleMap component (that's for /directions/ only)

**Distance data note:** Use "about" before distances as they are approximate. The STATE.md blocker notes these must be verified against Google Maps before publishing — use the research-verified figures for now. Consistency across pages matters: use the same numbers that will appear on /directions/.

Run `npm run build` — build must succeed with no errors.

Verify the built HTML:
- Check `dist/near-grand-canyon/index.html` exists
- Confirm it contains page-specific og:url with "/near-grand-canyon/"
- Confirm it contains page-specific og:title (not the homepage default)
- Confirm standalone `<p>` elements for each city distance fact
- Confirm cross-link to `/directions/` with trailing slash
- Confirm cross-link to `/` (homepage)

Run `npm run test:aeo` — check for any regressions or new issues on the near-grand-canyon page.
  </verify>
  <done>
/near-grand-canyon/ page is live in build output with: answer-first H1 containing distance from Grand Canyon, 8 standalone extractable city distance paragraphs, 5 dish recommendations, hours/contact info, cross-links to /directions/ and homepage, and page-specific title/description/OG tags. No images, fast LCP.
