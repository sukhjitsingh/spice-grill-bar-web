<objective>
Fix every broken NAP data point in RestaurantSchema.astro, sync faq.json hours to match confirmed business hours, correct the visible hours in Footer.astro, and audit all other faq.json answers for any remaining NAP inconsistencies.

Purpose: Phase 1 is the foundation — no new SEO signals ship on top of incorrect data. Google Rich Results Test must show zero errors for RestaurantSchema after this fix.

Output: Three corrected files. All structured data and visible UI reflect the same confirmed hours (Monday closed, Tue–Thu 08:00–21:00, Fri–Sun 08:00–22:00), E.164 phone (+1-928-277-1292), and canonical URL (https://spicegrillbar66.com, no www).

Confirmed business data (source of truth):

- Hours: Monday CLOSED / Tuesday–Thursday 08:00–21:00 / Friday–Sunday 08:00–22:00
- Phone E.164: +1-928-277-1292
- Canonical URL: https://spicegrillbar66.com (no www prefix)

Current bugs in RestaurantSchema.astro (verified by reading the file):

- url: 'https://www.spicegrillbar66.com' ← has www, wrong
- telephone: '(928) 277-1292' ← wrong format
- openingHoursSpecification: Monday–Thursday 07:00–22:00, Saturday–Sunday 07:00–22:00 ← completely wrong

Current bug in faq.json (verified):

- Hours entry answer: "We are open Monday through Thursday from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM, and Friday through Sunday from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM."
  ← Monday should be closed; wording and format need update

Current bug in Footer.astro (verified):

- Shows "Mon - Thurs 8AM - 9PM" — Monday must not appear as an open day

OrganizationSchema.astro already has correct phone (+1-928-277-1292) and URL — no change needed there.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix RestaurantSchema — hours, telephone, url</name>
  <files>src/components/schema/RestaurantSchema.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace the three incorrect values in the schema object:

1. **url** (line 8): Change `'https://www.spicegrillbar66.com'` → `'https://spicegrillbar66.com'`

2. **telephone** (line 17): Change `'(928) 277-1292'` → `'+1-928-277-1292'`

3. **openingHoursSpecification** (lines 18–37): Replace the two-entry array with three correct entries. Monday is omitted entirely (schema.org convention — only list days that are open). Do NOT use an explicit "closes: '00:00'" for Monday — omission is correct and simpler.

The replacement array must be:

```ts
openingHoursSpecification: [
  {
    '@type': 'OpeningHoursSpecification',
    dayOfWeek: [
      'https://schema.org/Tuesday',
      'https://schema.org/Wednesday',
      'https://schema.org/Thursday',
    ],
    opens: '08:00',
    closes: '21:00',
  },
  {
    '@type': 'OpeningHoursSpecification',
    dayOfWeek: [
      'https://schema.org/Friday',
      'https://schema.org/Saturday',
      'https://schema.org/Sunday',
    ],
    opens: '08:00',
    closes: '22:00',
  },
],
```

Do not touch any other property (servesCuisine, priceRange, image, hasMenu, areaServed, address, name, description). Those are Phase 2 scope.
</action>
<verify>
Run: `npm run typecheck` from the project root — must exit 0 with no TypeScript errors.

Also confirm with grep: `grep -n "telephone\|url\|opens\|closes\|Monday" src/components/schema/RestaurantSchema.astro` — output must show:

- telephone: '+1-928-277-1292'
- url: 'https://spicegrillbar66.com' (no www)
- No Monday in dayOfWeek arrays
- opens: '08:00' (not '07:00')
- closes: '21:00' and '22:00' (not a single '22:00' for all days)
  </verify>
  <done>
  RestaurantSchema.astro compiles cleanly. The url, telephone, and openingHoursSpecification values all match confirmed business data exactly. Monday does not appear in any dayOfWeek array. Tue–Thu closes at 21:00, Fri–Sun closes at 22:00.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Fix faq.json hours entry, audit all entries for NAP consistency, fix Footer.astro visible hours</name>
  <files>src/data/faq.json, src/components/Footer.astro</files>
  <action>
**Step A — Fix faq.json hours answer:**

Find the entry with `"question": "What are the operating hours for Spice Grill & Bar?"`.

Replace its `"answer"` value with:
`"Tue–Thu 8am–9pm, Fri–Sun 8am–10pm, closed Mondays."`

Rules per user decision:

- 12-hour format (8am–9pm, not 08:00)
- Explicitly state "closed Mondays"
- Call out the Tue–Thu / Fri–Sun split
- No CTA, no extra context — hours only

**Step B — Audit all other faq.json entries for NAP inconsistencies:**

Read every answer in faq.json and check for:

- Any phone number not matching +1-928-277-1292 or (928) 277-1292 display form — fix to display form `(928) 277-1292` in human-readable text (E.164 only needed in schema markup, not FAQ prose)
- Any URL referencing www.spicegrillbar66.com — fix to spicegrillbar66.com
- Any hours reference that contradicts confirmed hours (Monday closed, Tue–Thu 8am–9pm, Fri–Sun 8am–10pm)

The current faq.json has 9 entries. Read each answer. Fix any inconsistencies found in place. Do not rewrite answers beyond what is needed for NAP accuracy.

**Step C — Fix Footer.astro visible hours:**

In `src/components/Footer.astro`, find the hours `<ul>` block (lines 56–65). Currently it shows:

```
Mon - Thurs   8AM - 9PM
Fri - Sun     8AM - 10PM
```

Replace it with the correct three-row display:

```html
<li class="flex justify-between">
  <span>Monday</span>
  <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">Closed</span>
</li>
<li class="flex justify-between">
  <span>Tue – Thu</span>
  <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">8AM – 9PM</span>
</li>
<li class="flex justify-between">
  <span>Fri – Sun</span>
  <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">8AM – 10PM</span>
</li>
```

Keep all existing Tailwind classes on the `<ul>` and `<li>` elements. Only the content changes.
</action>
<verify>

1. `grep -n "Monday\|Tue\|Fri\|closed" src/data/faq.json` — must show the updated hours answer containing "closed Mondays" and "Tue–Thu 8am–9pm".

2. `grep -n "Mon\|Closed\|8AM\|9PM\|10PM" src/components/Footer.astro` — must show Monday / Closed / Tue–Thu / 8AM–9PM / Fri–Sun / 8AM–10PM.

3. Run `npm run typecheck` — must exit 0.

4. Run `npm run build` — must complete without errors. This confirms FAQSchema.astro (which imports faq.json) still renders correctly after the JSON edit.
   </verify>
   <done>
   faq.json hours answer explicitly states "Tue–Thu 8am–9pm, Fri–Sun 8am–10pm, closed Mondays." in 12-hour format with no CTA. All other faq.json entries have been audited — no remaining NAP inconsistencies. Footer.astro visible hours show Monday as Closed, Tue–Thu as 8AM–9PM, Fri–Sun as 8AM–10PM. Build passes.
   </done>
   </task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete, run the full quality suite:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:aeo
npm run lint
```

All three must exit 0 with no errors.

Manual spot-check: Open `dist/index.html` and search for the JSON-LD Restaurant schema. Verify:

- `"telephone": "+1-928-277-1292"` is present
- `"url": "https://spicegrillbar66.com"` (no www)
- `openingHoursSpecification` has exactly 2 entries — Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday (08:00–21:00) and Friday/Saturday/Sunday (08:00–22:00)
- Monday does not appear in any dayOfWeek array
  </verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 1 is complete when ALL of the following are true:

1. `npm run build` exits 0
2. `npm run test:aeo` exits 0 with no regressions
3. `npm run lint` exits 0
4. RestaurantSchema in built HTML has telephone=+1-928-277-1292, url=https://spicegrillbar66.com (no www), Monday absent from openingHoursSpecification, Tue–Thu closes=21:00, Fri–Sun closes=22:00
5. faq.json hours answer contains "closed Mondays" and "Tue–Thu 8am–9pm"
6. Footer.astro visible hours show Monday as Closed
   </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-schema-fixes/01-01-SUMMARY.md` with:
- What was changed in each file
- Actual values before and after for each fix
- Any NAP inconsistencies found (or confirmed absence) in the faq.json audit
- Build and test results
- Any notes on www/non-www redirect situation if relevant
</output>
