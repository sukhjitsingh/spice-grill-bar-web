<objective>
Expand faq.json from 9 to 20 highway/route-targeted FAQ entries, rewrite existing entries that violate AEO style rules, reorder all 20 entries by search intent priority, and verify FAQSchema renders everything dynamically.

Purpose: AI engines and voice assistants surface FAQ structured data when answering queries about Indian restaurants near the Grand Canyon, I-40 food stops, and Route 66 dining. Growing from 9 generic entries to 20 targeted entries directly captures these high-value search intents.

Output: Updated faq.json with 20 entries passing AEO audit; confirmed FAQSchema dynamic rendering.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Author 20 faq.json entries with AEO-compliant content and intent-priority ordering</name>
  <files>src/data/faq.json</files>
  <action>
Replace faq.json with a complete rewrite of all 20 entries. This is a full replacement — do not append to the existing array. Every entry has exactly two fields: `question` and `answer`. No metadata, no categories.

**Entries requiring rewrite from existing 9:**
- Q1 ("What type of food...") — uses "authentic" and ends with marketing fluff ("culinary excellence"). Rewrite to lead with cuisine type fact, name specific dishes, no "authentic".
- Q3 ("vegetarian or vegan options") — uses "authentic spices". Rewrite to remove "authentic", lead with the fact.
- Q4 ("Where is Spice Grill & Bar located?") — starts with "We are" instead of restaurant name. Rewrite to start with "Spice Grill & Bar is located at..."
- All other existing entries: review and adjust phrasing to match answer-first style if needed, but content is largely fine.

**11 new entries to author** (covering all CONTEXT.md required topics):

1. **Grand Canyon proximity (voice/discovery):** Question like "Is there an Indian restaurant near the Grand Canyon?" — anonymous voice-style phrasing. Answer: ~70 miles from South Rim, ~1 hour drive, mention Ash Fork and I-40 Exit 146.

2. **I-40 pitstop:** Question like "Is Spice Grill & Bar a good I-40 food stop?" — branded. Answer: right off I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, mention quick stop, fresh food.

3. **Grand Canyon distance (branded):** Question like "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?" Answer: about 70 miles, roughly an hour via AZ-64 and I-40.

4. **Las Vegas distance (journey intent):** Question like "Where to eat between Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon?" Answer: Spice Grill & Bar is about halfway on I-40, ~3 hours from Las Vegas, mention Exit 146.

5. **Flagstaff proximity (journey intent):** Question like "Where to eat between Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon?" Answer: about 50 miles west of Flagstaff on I-40, ~40 minutes.

6. **Phoenix distance (journey intent):** Question like "Where to eat on the way from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon?" Answer: about 3 hours north of Phoenix via I-17 to I-40.

7. **Kingman proximity (journey intent):** Question like "Where to eat between Kingman and the Grand Canyon?" Answer: about 80 miles east of Kingman on I-40.

8. **Williams/Seligman call-ahead pickup:** Question like "Can I order ahead from Williams or Seligman?" Answer: call-ahead pickup — call the restaurant, food is ready when they arrive in Ash Fork. NOT delivery. NOT a pickup location in those towns. Include phone number: 928-277-1292.

9. **Road-tripper dish recommendations (for Indian food newbies):** Question like "What should I order if I've never had Indian food?" Answer: recommend Butter Chicken (mild, creamy), Garlic Naan, Tandoori Chicken. Frame for someone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine. No prices.

10. **RV/truck parking:** Question like "Is there RV or truck parking near Spice Grill & Bar?" Answer: RV and truck parking available across the road at the truck stop. Regular car and motorcycle parking at the restaurant.

11. **Biker-friendly / Route 66 culture:** Question like "Is Spice Grill & Bar biker-friendly?" Answer: mention biker-friendly, Route 66 heritage (Route 66 in answer only, not question), motorcycle parking at restaurant.

Plus one more from CONTEXT.md required list:

12. **Spice levels / heat customization:** Question like "Can I customize how spicy my food is?" or "Does Spice Grill & Bar adjust spice levels?" Answer: yes, dishes can be adjusted from mild to extra hot. Good for travelers unfamiliar with Indian food.

Note: That's 12 new topic ideas for 11 slots. Resolve by merging the biker-friendly entry with the existing parking entry (rewrite Q6 to cover practical parking including RV direction, then add a separate biker/Route 66 culture entry). Or merge two distance entries if one feels redundant. Use judgment — the key is exactly 20 entries total.

**Ordering (search intent priority, per CONTEXT.md locked decision):**
1. Location/discovery/pitstop entries first (Grand Canyon proximity voice query, location, I-40 pitstop)
2. Highway-specific distance entries (Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Flagstaff, Phoenix, Kingman)
3. Food/cuisine entries (what type of food, popular dishes, road-tripper recs, spice levels, vegetarian/vegan)
4. Operational entries (hours, takeout, call-ahead pickup, parking, RV parking, biker-friendly, alcohol, kid-friendly)

**Style rules (ALL are locked decisions from CONTEXT.md):**
- Answer-first: lead with the fact, not "Yes, we..." before the fact
- Restaurant name "Spice Grill & Bar" in the first sentence of every answer
- Mix first/third person: restaurant name first sentence, then "we" for details
- Friendly approximations for distances: "about 70 miles" not "69.8 miles"
- No prices / no dollar amounts
- No "authentic" anywhere
- Route 66 in answers only, never in questions
- Voice-style phrasing for discovery entries (anonymous, natural spoken)
- Journey-intent phrasing for distance entries ("Where to eat between X and Y?")
- Mix branded and anonymous questions
- ≤50 words per answer (AEO audit hard limit — aim for 35-45 for buffer)
- No holiday hours, peak times, reservations, or catering entries

**Word count verification:** After writing all 20 entries, manually count words in each answer using the same method as the AEO audit: `answer.split(/\s+/).length`. Every answer MUST be ≤50.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `node -e "const faq = require('./src/data/faq.json'); console.log('Count:', faq.length); faq.forEach((q, i) => { const wc = q.answer.split(/\\s+/).length; const auth = q.answer.toLowerCase().includes('authentic'); const r66q = q.question.toLowerCase().includes('route 66'); console.log(i+1 + '. [' + wc + 'w]' + (auth ? ' AUTHENTIC!' : '') + (r66q ? ' ROUTE66-IN-Q!' : '') + (wc > 50 ? ' OVER-50!' : '') + ' ' + q.question.substring(0, 60)); })"`

Then run: `npm run test:aeo`

Then run: `npm run build` to confirm no build errors.

All must pass with zero errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
faq.json contains exactly 20 entries. Every answer is ≤50 words, answer-first, uses restaurant name in first sentence, contains no "authentic", no prices, no Route 66 in questions. Entries ordered by intent priority. npm run test:aeo passes. Build succeeds.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify FAQSchema.astro and faq.astro render all 20 entries dynamically</name>
  <files>src/components/schema/FAQSchema.astro, src/pages/faq.astro</files>
  <action>
This is a verification task — no code changes expected unless a problem is found.

**Step 1: Read FAQSchema.astro** and confirm:
- It imports faq.json via `import faqData from '../../data/faq.json'`
- It uses `faqData.map()` with NO `.slice()`, NO index limit, NO hardcoded count
- The schema type is `FAQPage` with `mainEntity` containing the mapped questions

**Step 2: Read faq.astro** and confirm:
- It imports faq.json
- It uses `.map()` with NO `.slice()`, NO index limit, NO hardcoded count
- All entries render on the page

**Step 3: Build and inspect output** — run `npm run build` then check the built FAQ page for all 20 entries in the JSON-LD script tag:
- `grep -c '"@type":"Question"' dist/faq/index.html` should return 20
- `grep -c '"@type":"Question"' dist/index.html` should return 20 (if FAQSchema is global via Layout.astro)

**Step 4: If FAQSchema is injected globally via Layout.astro** (research indicates it is), note this in the summary as a future consideration but do NOT change the injection scope — it's outside phase 3 scope.

**If any hardcoded limit is found:** Remove it by changing the code to use unbounded `.map()`. This would be the only code change in this task.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `npm run build`
Run: `node -e "const html = require('fs').readFileSync('dist/faq/index.html', 'utf8'); const matches = html.match(/\"@type\":\"Question\"/g); console.log('FAQ page schema questions:', matches ? matches.length : 0)"`

The count must be 20.

Run: `npm run test:aeo` — must pass with zero errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
FAQSchema.astro confirmed to use unbounded .map() — all 20 faq.json entries emit as structured data. faq.astro renders all 20 entries on the page. Build succeeds. AEO audit passes.
  </done>
