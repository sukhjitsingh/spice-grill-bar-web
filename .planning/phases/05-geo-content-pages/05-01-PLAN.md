<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend Layout.astro with per-page OpenGraph props</name>
  <files>src/layouts/Layout.astro</files>
  <action>
Add optional OG props to Layout.astro frontmatter destructuring:

```typescript
const {
  title = 'Spice Grill & Bar | Best Indian & Punjabi Food in Ash Fork, AZ (Route 66)',
  description = '...',
  ogTitle,
  ogDescription,
  ogUrl,
} = Astro.props;
```

Update the OG meta tags in `<head>` to use dynamic values with fallbacks:
- `og:url` → `{ogUrl ?? canonicalURL}` (use the already-computed canonicalURL as fallback, not a hardcoded string)
- `og:title` → `{ogTitle ?? title}` (fall back to page title)
- `og:description` → `{ogDescription ?? description}` (fall back to page description)

Also update the Twitter card meta tags the same way:
- `twitter:url` → `{ogUrl ?? canonicalURL}`
- `twitter:title` → `{ogTitle ?? title}`
- `twitter:description` → `{ogDescription ?? description}`

This is a minimal change — 3 new optional props, 6 meta tag updates. Do NOT change any other Layout.astro behavior. Existing pages that don't pass OG props will get the same behavior as before (fallback to title/description/canonicalURL).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run typecheck` to confirm no TypeScript errors. Verify that the existing homepage and faq page still build correctly: `npm run build` should succeed without errors.
  </verify>
  <done>Layout.astro accepts optional ogTitle, ogDescription, ogUrl props and uses them in OG and Twitter meta tags with fallbacks to title/description/canonicalURL.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create /near-grand-canyon/ page with AEO passage structure</name>
  <files>src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro` following the faq.astro page shell pattern. Use the verified distance data from 05-RESEARCH.md.

**CRITICAL — Distance consistency:** Use "about 78 miles" and "about 1 hour 20 minutes" for Grand Canyon South Rim everywhere. These figures must match what will appear in faq.json (Task 3 updates those).

**Layout props:**
- title: "Indian Restaurant Near Grand Canyon | About 78 Miles — Spice Grill & Bar"
- description: "Spice Grill & Bar in Ash Fork, AZ is about 78 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim — roughly 1 hour 20 minutes via I-40 Exit 146. Authentic Punjabi Indian cuisine on Route 66."
- ogTitle: "Indian Restaurant Near Grand Canyon — Spice Grill & Bar"
- ogDescription: "About 78 miles from Grand Canyon South Rim. Authentic Punjabi cuisine at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, AZ."
- ogUrl: "https://spicegrillbar66.com/near-grand-canyon/"

**Page structure (in order):**

1. **Answer-first H1:** "Spice Grill & Bar — About 78 Miles from Grand Canyon South Rim"
   - Use Playfair Display (font-serif), text-4xl md:text-5xl, brand orange span for the distance portion

2. **Lead paragraph (standalone `<p>`):** Third-person factual statement: "Spice Grill & Bar is located in Ash Fork, Arizona, about 78 miles south of the Grand Canyon South Rim — roughly 1 hour and 20 minutes via AZ-64 South and I-40 Exit 146. It is the closest Indian restaurant to the Grand Canyon on the I-40 corridor."

3. **Standalone "I-40 Exit 146" sentence** — a separate `<p>` early on the page: "Spice Grill & Bar is located at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, Arizona." (12-word voice-extractable answer — per CONTEXT.md requirement)

4. **"Why Stop Here" section** (`<section>` with `<h2>`): A paragraph explaining the recommendation rationale for AI engines. Content should mention: one of the few sit-down restaurants between Williams and Seligman on I-40, authentic Punjabi cuisine, family-friendly, beer and wine available, fresh-baked naan and tandoor cooking. Keep it 40-60 words, third-person voice. This gives AI engines a reason to recommend the restaurant, not just list it.

5. **"Distance from Nearby Cities" section** (`<section>` with `<h2>`):
   Each city as a standalone `<p>` paragraph (NOT list items). Use this format for each:
   "Spice Grill & Bar is [distance] from [City] — about [drive time] [direction] on I-40. Take Exit 146 in Ash Fork."

   Cities and verified data (from 05-RESEARCH.md):
   - Grand Canyon South Rim: ~78 miles, ~1 hr 20 min, via AZ-64 S and I-40
   - Flagstaff, AZ: ~51 miles, ~46 minutes, west on I-40
   - Williams, AZ: ~18 miles, ~18 minutes, east on I-40
   - Seligman, AZ: ~25 miles, ~24 minutes, west on I-40
   - Las Vegas, NV: ~200 miles, ~3 hours, via US-93 and I-40
   - Los Angeles, CA: ~414 miles, ~6 hours, east on I-40
   - Kingman, AZ: ~97 miles, ~1.5 hours, east on I-40
   - Phoenix, AZ: ~144 miles, ~2 hours 40 minutes, via I-17 N and I-40

6. **"What to Order" section** (`<section>` with `<h2>`):
   Feature the top 5 menu items by popularity (from 05-RESEARCH.md):
   - Fish Pakora ($10.99) — "Marinated fish fried in crispy chickpea batter — a road-trip crowd favorite"
   - Butter Chicken ($15.99) — "Rich butter-cream and tomato sauce with tender chicken thighs"
   - Shahi Paneer ($15.99) — "Cottage cheese in savory buttery cream sauce — a vegetarian favorite"
   - Chicken Biryani ($17.99) — "Fragrant basmati rice sautéed with chicken and aromatic spices"
   - Garlic Naan ($3.99) — "Freshly baked and drizzled with butter and garlic"

   Use a simple styled list or card grid. Include a brief intro: "We recommend these popular dishes for travelers stopping in from the road." (first person per CONTEXT.md voice decision)

7. **Operating hours as standalone `<p>` paragraph** (per CONTEXT.md — NOT table/list, for voice extraction):
   "Spice Grill & Bar is open Tuesday through Thursday from 8 AM to 9 PM, and Friday through Sunday from 8 AM to 10 PM. The restaurant is closed on Mondays."

8. **Cross-links section:** Use keyword-rich anchor text (per CONTEXT.md — NOT generic phrases):
   - Link to /directions/: "Driving directions to Spice Grill & Bar from 7 cities"
   - Link to homepage: "View the full Spice Grill & Bar menu"
   - Link to /faq/: "Frequently asked questions about Spice Grill & Bar"

9. **Page-specific inline FAQ schema** — Add a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block at the bottom of the page (inside `<main>`, before closing Layout) with 2-3 FAQ pairs that target the exact queries this page answers. These are SEPARATE from the global FAQSchema injected by Layout.astro. Suggested pairs:
   - Q: "Is there an Indian restaurant near the Grand Canyon?" / A: "Yes. Spice Grill & Bar in Ash Fork, Arizona is about 78 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim — roughly 1 hour 20 minutes via I-40 Exit 146."
   - Q: "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?" / A: "Spice Grill & Bar is about 78 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim, approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes by car via AZ-64 South and I-40."
   - Q: "What is the best restaurant to stop at near the Grand Canyon?" / A: "Spice Grill & Bar in Ash Fork, AZ offers authentic Punjabi Indian cuisine about 78 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim, at I-40 Exit 146."

10. **Speakable schema markup** — Add a `<script type="application/ld+json">` with speakable schema targeting the H1 and lead paragraph. Use CSS selectors to identify speakable sections:
    ```json
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "WebPage",
      "name": "Indian Restaurant Near Grand Canyon",
      "speakable": {
        "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
        "cssSelector": [".speakable-heading", ".speakable-lead", ".speakable-hours"]
      }
    }
    ```
    Add the corresponding CSS classes to the H1 (`speakable-heading`), lead paragraph (`speakable-lead`), and hours paragraph (`speakable-hours`).

**Styling:** Match homepage visual style. Use `pt-32 pb-24 px-6 bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-black min-h-screen` for main container (same as faq.astro). Use glassmorphism cards where appropriate (glass-card class). Brand colors for headings and accents. No images above the fold — text-only hero for fast LCP. All links must have trailing slashes.

**Tailwind details:** max-w-4xl mx-auto container. H2 headings: text-2xl md:text-3xl font-serif font-bold. Paragraphs: text-lg leading-relaxed text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300. Spacing: mb-6 between paragraphs, mb-12 between sections.

  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — should succeed and generate `dist/near-grand-canyon/index.html`. Verify the built HTML contains: (1) the inline FAQ schema JSON-LD, (2) the speakable schema JSON-LD, (3) "I-40 Exit 146" appears at least twice (standalone sentence + within city distances), (4) all 8 city distance paragraphs are standalone `<p>` elements, (5) OG meta tags show page-specific values not homepage defaults. Run `npm run typecheck` for type safety.
  </verify>
  <done>/near-grand-canyon/ page is live with answer-first H1, standalone city distance paragraphs, "why stop here" paragraph, hours as standalone paragraph, dish recommendations, inline FAQ schema, speakable schema, I-40 Exit 146 standalone sentence, and keyword-rich cross-links. All OG tags are page-specific.</done>

  <name>Task 3: Fix llms.txt, llms-full.txt, and update faq.json distance consistency</name>
  <files>public/llms.txt, public/llms-full.txt, src/data/faq.json</files>
  <action>
**llms.txt fixes (all three from CONTEXT.md):**

1. **Fix Monday hours error:** Change "Mon - Thurs: 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM" to two lines:
   - "Mon: Closed"
   - "Tue - Thu: 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM"
   Keep "Fri - Sun: 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM" unchanged.

2. **Add new page URLs** to the Links section:
   - "- **Near Grand Canyon**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/near-grand-canyon/"
   - "- **Directions**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/directions/"
   - "- **FAQ**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/faq/"

3. **Add proximity keywords section** after the Key Information section:
   ```
   ## Location & Proximity
   - Spice Grill & Bar is located at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, Arizona
   - About 78 miles south of Grand Canyon South Rim (~1 hr 20 min)
   - 51 miles west of Flagstaff on I-40
   - 18 miles from Williams, AZ
   - 97 miles east of Kingman on I-40
   - On historic Route 66
   ```

4. Also fix the FAQ section in llms.txt — update the hours Q&A to match:
   "A: Tuesday-Thursday 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM, Friday-Sunday 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM. Closed Mondays."

**llms-full.txt fixes (same hours error + enhancements):**

5. **Fix Monday hours error in llms-full.txt:** Change "Monday - Thursday: 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM" (line 19) to two lines:
   - "**Monday**: Closed"
   - "**Tuesday - Thursday**: 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM"
   Keep "**Friday - Sunday**: 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM" unchanged.

6. **Add Location & Proximity section** to llms-full.txt after the "Location & Contact" section:
   ```
   ## Location & Proximity
   - Located at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, Arizona, on historic Route 66
   - About 78 miles south of Grand Canyon South Rim (~1 hr 20 min drive)
   - 51 miles west of Flagstaff on I-40
   - 18 miles from Williams, AZ (gateway to Grand Canyon Railway)
   - 97 miles east of Kingman on I-40
   - 144 miles north of Phoenix via I-17 and I-40
   - 200 miles east of Las Vegas via US-93 and I-40
   ```

7. **Add page URLs** to llms-full.txt — add a "Pages" section before the Links section:
   ```
   ## Pages
   - **Home**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/
   - **Near Grand Canyon**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/near-grand-canyon/
   - **Directions**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/directions/
   - **FAQ**: https://spicegrillbar66.com/faq/
   ```

**faq.json distance consistency:**

Update ALL faq.json entries that reference Grand Canyon distance to use "about 78 miles" consistently (currently says "about 70 miles"). Entries to update:
- Entry with question "Is there an Indian restaurant near the Grand Canyon?" — change "about 70 miles" to "about 78 miles" and "roughly an hour's drive" to "roughly 1 hour 20 minutes"
- Entry with question "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?" — change "about 70 miles" to "about 78 miles" and "roughly an hour's drive" to "roughly 1 hour 20 minutes"

Also verify the Flagstaff entry says "about 50 miles" (close enough to 51, acceptable rounding) and Kingman entry says "about 80 miles" (97 in research — update to "about 97 miles east of Kingman" and update drive time to "about 1.5 hours" if currently different). Check all city distances in faq.json against the verified data in 05-RESEARCH.md and correct any that are significantly off.

Do NOT change any faq.json entries that don't have distance discrepancies. Preserve the existing AEO writing style (answer-first, under 60 words).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` to confirm faq.json is still valid JSON and the site builds. Run `npm run test:aeo` to verify the AEO audit still passes. Grep the built output for "about 78 miles" — it should appear in both the /near-grand-canyon/ page and in the FAQ schema output. Grep for "Mon: Closed" in both dist/llms.txt and dist/llms-full.txt. Verify no faq.json entry says "about 70 miles" anymore. Verify llms-full.txt contains the "Location & Proximity" section and "Pages" section.
  </verify>
  <done>Both llms.txt and llms-full.txt have correct Monday hours ("Mon: Closed"/"Monday: Closed"), new page URLs (/near-grand-canyon/, /directions/, /faq/), and proximity keywords with distance data. faq.json distances are consistent with verified data (78 miles to Grand Canyon, not 70). All distance figures across the site are consistent.</done>
