<objective>
Create the /directions/ page with per-city turn-by-turn directions, Google Maps embed, inline FAQ schema, and speakable schema. Verify cross-links between both pages use keyword-rich anchor text. Run full QA to confirm both pages pass Lighthouse CI.

Purpose: Capture "directions to Indian restaurant near Grand Canyon / I-40" queries. Each city section must be self-contained for AI extraction with distance, drive time, turn-by-turn instructions, and NAP data.

Output: Live /directions/ page, verified cross-links, passing Lighthouse CI for both new pages.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create /directions/ page with per-city H2 sections and Google Maps embed</name>
  <files>src/pages/directions.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/pages/directions.astro` following the faq.astro page shell pattern.

**Layout props:**
- title: "Directions to Spice Grill & Bar | I-40 Exit 146, Ash Fork, AZ"
- description: "Step-by-step driving directions to Spice Grill & Bar from Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Flagstaff, Kingman, Phoenix, Williams, and Seligman. Take I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, AZ."
- ogTitle: "Directions to Spice Grill & Bar — I-40 Exit 146"
- ogDescription: "Driving directions from 7 cities to Spice Grill & Bar in Ash Fork, AZ. Take I-40 Exit 146."
- ogUrl: "https://spicegrillbar66.com/directions/"

**Import GoogleMap component:**
```astro
---
import { GoogleMap } from '@/components/GoogleMap';
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
const API_KEY = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;
---
```

**Page structure (in order):**

1. **Answer-first H1:** "Directions to Spice Grill & Bar" with subtitle span "I-40 Exit 146, Ash Fork, AZ" in brand orange. Same font/size pattern as /near-grand-canyon/.

2. **Lead paragraph:** "Spice Grill & Bar is located at 33 Lewis Ave, Ash Fork, Arizona 86320, directly off I-40 Exit 146 on historic Route 66. Below you will find step-by-step driving directions from seven cities."

3. **Standalone "I-40 Exit 146" sentence** (per CONTEXT.md — separate `<p>` early on page): "Spice Grill & Bar is located at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, Arizona." Add class `speakable-exit` for speakable schema.

4. **City section anchor navigation** — A simple `<nav>` with anchor links to all 7 city sections. Use a horizontal flex/wrap layout on desktop, vertical on mobile. Example: "Jump to: Flagstaff | Williams | Seligman | Las Vegas | Los Angeles | Kingman | Phoenix". Pure HTML anchor links (#flagstaff, #williams, etc.) — no JavaScript needed.

5. **Per-city H2 sections** — Each city gets a `<section id="city-slug">` with:
   - H2: "From [City], [State] — [Distance] [Direction] on I-40" (include drive time in the H2 or first sentence)
   - Turn-by-turn paragraph: 2-4 sentences covering the route, with `<strong>Exit 146</strong>` emphasized. Keep it concise and factual. End with "Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave on your [left/right]."
   - NAP `<address>` block within each section (brief — name, full address, phone link):
     ```html
     <address>
       <strong>Spice Grill & Bar</strong><br/>
       33 Lewis Ave, Ash Fork, AZ 86320<br/>
       <a href="tel:+19282771292">(928) 277-1292</a>
     </address>
     ```

   **City order and verified directions data (from 05-RESEARCH.md):**

   a. **Flagstaff, AZ** (id="flagstaff") — 51 miles, ~46 min, I-40 West
      "From Flagstaff, take I-40 West toward Kingman. Drive 51 miles (about 46 minutes) and take Exit 146 (Ash Fork / Historic Route 66). Turn right onto Lewis Ave — Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave on your right."

   b. **Williams, AZ** (id="williams") — 18 miles, ~18 min, I-40 West
      "From Williams, take I-40 West. Drive 18 miles (about 18 minutes) and take Exit 146. Turn right onto Lewis Ave — Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave on your right."

   c. **Seligman, AZ** (id="seligman") — 25 miles, ~24 min, I-40 East
      "From Seligman, take I-40 East toward Flagstaff. Drive 25 miles (about 24 minutes) and take Exit 146. Turn left onto Lewis Ave — Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave on your left."

   d. **Las Vegas, NV** (id="las-vegas") — ~200 miles, ~3 hours, US-93 S to I-40 E
      "From Las Vegas, take US-93 South to I-40 East. Drive approximately 200 miles (about 3 hours) and take Exit 146 in Ash Fork. Turn right onto Lewis Ave — Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave."

   e. **Los Angeles, CA** (id="los-angeles") — ~414 miles, ~6 hours, I-40 East
      "From Los Angeles, take I-15 North to I-40 East through Barstow and Needles. Drive approximately 414 miles (about 6 hours) and take Exit 146 in Ash Fork. Turn right onto Lewis Ave."

   f. **Kingman, AZ** (id="kingman") — ~97 miles, ~1.5 hours, I-40 East
      "From Kingman, take I-40 East toward Flagstaff. Drive 97 miles (about 1 hour 30 minutes) and take Exit 146. Turn right onto Lewis Ave — Spice Grill & Bar is at 33 Lewis Ave on your right."

   g. **Phoenix, AZ** (id="phoenix") — ~144 miles, ~2 hr 40 min, I-17 N to I-40 W
      "From Phoenix, take I-17 North to Flagstaff, then I-40 West. Drive approximately 144 miles (about 2 hours 40 minutes) and take Exit 146 in Ash Fork. Turn right onto Lewis Ave."

6. **Google Maps embed** (below fold for LCP): Reuse the existing `GoogleMap.tsx` component with `client:visible`:
   ```astro
   <div class="w-full h-[400px] rounded-2xl overflow-hidden mt-12">
     <GoogleMap apiKey={API_KEY} client:visible />
   </div>
   ```
   Single map showing the restaurant location — NOT per-city maps.

7. **Cross-links section** — Keyword-rich anchor text:
   - Link to /near-grand-canyon/: "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?"
   - Link to homepage: "View the full Spice Grill & Bar menu"
   - Link to /faq/: "Frequently asked questions about Spice Grill & Bar"

8. **Page-specific inline FAQ schema** — `<script type="application/ld+json">` with 2-3 FAQ pairs targeting directions queries:
   - Q: "How do I get to Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?" / A: "From the Grand Canyon South Rim, drive south on AZ-64 to I-40 East. Take Exit 146 in Ash Fork and turn right onto Lewis Ave. The drive is about 78 miles and takes roughly 1 hour 20 minutes."
   - Q: "What exit is Spice Grill & Bar on I-40?" / A: "Spice Grill & Bar is at I-40 Exit 146 in Ash Fork, Arizona, at 33 Lewis Ave."
   - Q: "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from Flagstaff?" / A: "Spice Grill & Bar is 51 miles west of Flagstaff on I-40, about a 46-minute drive. Take Exit 146 in Ash Fork."

9. **Speakable schema markup** — `<script type="application/ld+json">`:
   ```json
   {
     "@context": "https://schema.org",
     "@type": "WebPage",
     "name": "Directions to Spice Grill & Bar",
     "speakable": {
       "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
       "cssSelector": [".speakable-heading", ".speakable-lead", ".speakable-exit"]
     }
   }
   ```
   Add classes `speakable-heading` to H1, `speakable-lead` to lead paragraph, `speakable-exit` to the standalone Exit 146 sentence.

**Styling:** Match homepage visual style. Same container pattern as faq.astro: `pt-32 pb-24 px-6 bg-zinc-50 dark:bg-black min-h-screen`, `max-w-4xl mx-auto`. Use alternating glass-card sections or subtle borders between city sections for visual separation. Each city section should have clear visual boundaries. NAP address blocks: slightly smaller text (text-sm), muted color. All links must have trailing slashes.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — should succeed and generate `dist/directions/index.html`. Verify: (1) all 7 city H2 sections present, (2) each section has an `<address>` block, (3) GoogleMap component is included, (4) inline FAQ schema JSON-LD present, (5) speakable schema JSON-LD present, (6) "Exit 146" appears in every city section + standalone sentence, (7) OG meta tags are page-specific. Run `npm run typecheck`.
  </verify>
  <done>/directions/ page is live with 7 per-city H2 sections, turn-by-turn directions emphasizing I-40 Exit 146, NAP address blocks, Google Maps embed (client:visible below fold), inline FAQ schema, speakable schema, anchor navigation, and keyword-rich cross-links.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify cross-links and run full QA</name>
  <files>src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro, src/pages/directions.astro</files>
  <action>
**Cross-link verification:**

1. Open `src/pages/near-grand-canyon.astro` and verify it has keyword-rich links to:
   - /directions/ (e.g., "Driving directions to Spice Grill & Bar from 7 cities")
   - / (e.g., "View the full Spice Grill & Bar menu")
   - /faq/ (e.g., "Frequently asked questions about Spice Grill & Bar")
   If any link uses generic text like "Get Directions" or "Click here", replace with keyword-rich anchor text per CONTEXT.md.

2. Open `src/pages/directions.astro` and verify it has keyword-rich links to:
   - /near-grand-canyon/ (e.g., "How far is Spice Grill & Bar from the Grand Canyon?")
   - / (e.g., "View the full Spice Grill & Bar menu")
   - /faq/ (e.g., "Frequently asked questions about Spice Grill & Bar")
   If any link uses generic text, fix it.

3. Verify ALL internal links use trailing slashes: `/directions/`, `/near-grand-canyon/`, `/faq/`, `/`.

**Distance consistency audit:**

Grep the built output for distance figures. Confirm:
- "78 miles" or "about 78 miles" appears consistently for Grand Canyon distance (never "70 miles" or "58 miles")
- faq.json distances match page content
- Both pages use the same figures for each city

**Full QA run:**

Run `npm run qa` (which executes: build + lint + knip + typecheck + AEO audit + Lighthouse CI). This is the pre-push hook — it must pass.

If LHCI fails:
- Check LCP < 4000ms (no images above fold should keep this fast)
- Check Accessibility >= 90 (all links have text, all images have alt, heading hierarchy correct)
- Check SEO >= 90 (title, meta description, canonical, OG tags present)
- Fix any issues found

If AEO audit fails:
- Check that answer-first paragraphs are within word limits
- Fix any flagged issues

**IMPORTANT:** If any QA check fails, fix the issue in the appropriate file and re-run. Both pages must pass all quality gates before this task is done.
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run qa` passes with exit code 0. Specifically: (1) `npm run build` succeeds, (2) `npm run lint` passes, (3) `npm run typecheck` passes, (4) `npm run test:aeo` passes, (5) `npm run test:lhci` passes with LCP < 4000ms, Accessibility >= 90, SEO >= 90 for both /near-grand-canyon/ and /directions/.
  </verify>
  <done>Both /near-grand-canyon/ and /directions/ pass full QA (build, lint, typecheck, AEO audit, Lighthouse CI). Cross-links use keyword-rich anchor text. All distance figures are consistent across both pages and faq.json. Phase 5 is complete.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
