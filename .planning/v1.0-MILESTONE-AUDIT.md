**Notes on SUMMARY frontmatter gaps:** 4 SUMMARY files (02-02, 03-01, 05-01) lack `requirements-completed` frontmatter fields. In all cases, the phase VERIFICATION.md provides thorough code-level evidence for satisfaction. These are documentation gaps, not code gaps. The PLAN files claim these requirements and the VERIFICATION files confirm them with specific file/line evidence.

**Note on CONT-03 scope:** Original requirement text includes "Header.tsx navigation array AND Footer.astro links." Header.tsx was deliberately excluded per user decision documented in `04-CONTEXT.md`. ROADMAP.md success criteria were updated accordingly. Footer Explore section fully delivers all links.

## Phase Verification Summary (5/5 Passed)

|-------|-------------------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1     | Schema Fixes            | 6/6     | passed | None              |

**Human verification items outstanding:**
1. Google Rich Results Test for all pages (Phases 1, 2, 5)
2. `npm run test:lhci` fresh run for /near-grand-canyon/ and /directions/ (Phase 5)
3. CONT-03 scope acceptance confirmation (Phase 4)

## Cross-Phase Integration (14/15 Wired)

### Wired (14 connections)

- RestaurantSchema → Layout.astro → all 4 pages (hours, phone, URL, geo, areaServed, aggregateRating, hasMap, potentialAction, containedInPlace)
- reviews.json → RestaurantSchema.astro (build-time aggregateRating computation)
- OrganizationSchema (sameAs) → Layout.astro → all pages
- WebSiteSchema (description, publisher) → Layout.astro → all pages
- faq.json → FAQSchema.astro (unbounded map) → all pages
- faq.json → faq.astro (unbounded map) → FAQ page
- slugToLabel() → BreadcrumbSchema → correct labels for /faq/, /near-grand-canyon/, /directions/
- .lighthouserc.json → covers /, /near-grand-canyon/, /directions/
- Footer Explore → links to /near-grand-canyon/, /directions/, /faq/
- /near-grand-canyon/ ↔ /directions/ (bidirectional keyword-rich cross-links)
- Both GEO pages → Layout.astro OG props (page-specific, not homepage defaults)
- llms.txt + llms-full.txt → list all 4 pages, correct hours, proximity keywords
- Both GEO pages → inline FAQPage + SpeakableSpecification schema
- New pages → Layout → inherit all 5 schema components

### Missing (1 connection)

- **Flagstaff distance data drift:** faq.json entry 6 states "about 50 miles...40-minute drive" while /near-grand-canyon/, /directions/, llms.txt, and llms-full.txt all use "51 miles...46 minutes." Cross-phase data inconsistency introduced when Phase 5 established verified distances but did not back-propagate to faq.json.

## E2E Flow Verification (6/6 Complete)

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Schema data consistency (hours, phone, URL) | Complete | All surfaces agree: Mon closed, Tue-Thu 08-21, Fri-Sun 08-22, +1-928-277-1292, spicegrillbar66.com |
| Navigation: homepage → GEO pages | Complete | Via Footer Explore section on all pages (Header deliberately excluded) |
| GEO page cross-linking | Complete | Bidirectional /near-grand-canyon/ ↔ /directions/ with keyword-rich anchors |
| Schema inheritance on new pages | Complete | All 5 schema components + BreadcrumbSchema inherited via Layout.astro |
| FAQ data pipeline | Complete | faq.json → FAQSchema (all pages) + faq.astro (FAQ page) + inline schemas (GEO pages) |
| OG tag isolation | Complete | New pages have unique ogTitle/ogDescription/ogUrl; fallback uses canonicalURL not hardcoded homepage |

## Tech Debt Summary

### By Phase

**Phase 2: Schema Additions**
- Google Maps URL implementation differs from REQUIREMENTS.md (documented deliberate decision)
- 02-02-SUMMARY.md missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter

**Phase 3: FAQ Expansion**
- FAQSchema injected globally — homepage emits 20 FAQ entries where FAQ content is not visually rendered
- 03-01-SUMMARY.md missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter

**Phase 4: Content Infrastructure**
- CONT-03 original text still references Header.tsx in REQUIREMENTS.md (scope narrowed by user decision)
- /faq/ page absent from .lighthouserc.json (pre-existing gap)

**Phase 5: GEO Content Pages**
- **Flagstaff distance inconsistency:** faq.json says 50 mi/40 min vs. 51 mi/46 min everywhere else
- Duplicate FAQPage schemas on GEO pages (global + page-specific)
- 05-01-SUMMARY.md missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter
- `tel:` URI format inconsistent (directions.astro uses E.164, others don't)
- geo.position meta tag vs RestaurantSchema coordinate precision mismatch (~14m)

### Total: 11 items across 4 phases (0 critical, 11 non-critical)
